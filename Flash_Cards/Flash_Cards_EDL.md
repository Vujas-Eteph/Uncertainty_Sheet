Some concepts: 
 - Homoscedasticity: Same variance for all R.V.
 - Heteroscedasticity: Different variance for the R.Vs

   - **1) What did the authors try to accomplish?**: 
     - Look how sound the theory behind EDL is.
   - **2) What were the key elements of the approach?**:  
     - Analyzing the loss and learning process.
   - **3) What can I use myself?**:
     - The referenes, and perhaps some of the mathematical proof ?
   - **4) What other references do I want to follow?**: 
     - Amini et al. 2020 [Evidential Deep Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02600)
