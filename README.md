# Uncertainty Sheet

**Preface**: This repository summarises valuable papers, packages, lectures and others I found during my research and *for* my research. Hence, this repository is not exhaustive. Other alternatives I highly recommend are [awesome-uncertainty-deeplearning](https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/awesome-uncertainty-deeplearning), *etc*.


-------

### :fire: TODO:
- Update the ReadMe regularly (at least once per week, discipline is king)
- Generate a Graph to list which conference is more likely to output papers in uncertainty quantification that might interest me (Based on the paper I might list in a seperate markdown file)
- List methods found in DL for uncertainty quantification
- List sub-methods for each method
- Categories the uncertainties methods in a table, like time complexity, memory complexity, easy to implement, and so on... welcome new suggestions
- Make a ranking of top uncertainty quantifications
- List N=3 courses that help understand the material presented in some of the papers
- Make a list of top profiles to look for and to follow on social media
- Make Flash Cards for each paper and Cheat sheets for some papers
- Make a .bib file (generate automatically)
