- Deep Ensemble produces more reliable uncertainty estimations than MC Dropout [ref. Masksembles]
- Types of Uncertainties :
  - Aleatoric (data) uncertainty (is inherent to the sensor (e.g., image resolution, ...)).
  - Epistemic (model) uncertainty (can be reduced with mode training data).
  - Distributional (data shift) uncertainty (the training data only captures a portion of the real-world distribution)
